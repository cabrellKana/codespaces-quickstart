  utter_model_cars:
    - text: "Model cars are scale replicas of vehicles. These models are often highly limited and available only for a limited time. Collecting model cars is particularly enjoyable due to the wide variety of models, even though not every model is available in every color."

  utter_materials:
    - text: "Most models today are primarily made of metal (die-cast). Attachments like mirrors or the interior are made of plastic. Details such as door handles are either only suggested in shape, highlighted by a colored print, or installed as a separate component. The amount of detail does not directly correlate with the size of the model. Smaller models can have as many details as larger versions. However, the level of detail usually has a direct impact on the price."

  utter_collector_preferences:
    - text: "Everyone has different areas of interest and preferences regarding model cars, making each collection as unique as the collector themselves. Whether it's Formula 1 vehicles, Ferraris, SUVs, red station wagons, Japanese cars, fire trucks, classic cars from the 1920s, American police cars, or anything else one likes, buses, beer trucks, convertibles... The variety of themes is almost limitless. Many collectors choose a specific scale to ensure that all models in the collection match in size. However, there are also, for example, Alfa Romeo fans (or fans of any other brand) who want every vehicle from that company in their collection, regardless of scale."

  utter_scales:
    - text: "Model vehicles are available in scales from 1:160 to 1:8. For example, the current S-Class from Mercedes, with a length of 5.04 meters, means in model scale: 
    Scale 1:160 approximately 3.1 cm
    Scale 1:87 approximately 5.80 cm
    Scale 1:76 approximately 6.60 cm
    Scale 1:64 approximately 7.90 cm
    Scale 1:50 approximately 10.0 cm
    Scale 1:45 approximately 11.2 cm
    Scale 1:43 approximately 11.7 cm
    Scale 1:36 approximately 14.0 cm
    Scale 1:32 approximately 15.8 cm
    Scale 1:24 approximately 20.1 cm
    Scale 1:18 approximately 28.0 cm
    Scale 1:12 approximately 42.0 cm
